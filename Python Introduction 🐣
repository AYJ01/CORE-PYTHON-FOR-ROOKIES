Python is one of the most popular programming languages, which has been in the limelight ✨ for more than 2 decades.

Don't you think that's why Python is so popular🌍? 

Python is a very popular, general-purpose, interpreted🚨, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level⚡ programming language. Python is a dynamically typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985-1990.


💠Interpreted: An interpreted language runs programs directly without converting them into machine code first. This means it executes instructions one at a time, making it easier to write and test code quickly.
(Simply Code is Executed Line By line, if we have any error lines before the error line, it works only on the error line, and lines after that don't work.

💠Interactive: You can type and run code immediately. You can enter Python commands into a prompt, and they execute right away, making it easy to test and experiment with code on the fly.

💠 Object-Oriented: It supports class concepts that help us to save functions, variables, and every data according to things in a single place.

💠 High-level programming language: A high-level programming language is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. It uses English-like syntax.


Note: Python is made up of C programming language.
