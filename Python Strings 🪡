Strings are enclosed by either single (') or double (") quotation marks.A string can be pretty much anything

Text: "Hello, world!" 

Numbers as Text: "12345" 

Special Characters: "!@#$%^&*()" 

Whitespace: " " (three spaces) â €

Empty String: "" or '' 

Multi-line Text: Enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """) 

Combination of Different Characters: "Python3 is fun!" 

so basically any thing inside double quotes is considered as string the python except

escape sequences and slash,double quots iteself and the single quots too 
Note : single quotes are also used for covering strings instead of double quotes
